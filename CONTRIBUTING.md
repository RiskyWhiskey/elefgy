## Using the issue tracker

## Bug reports

## Feature Requests

## Pull Requests

## Versioning and Release

All changes should be made within branches created from the `devel`
(development) branch and named clearly reflecting the purpose of the changes.
For example: `devel-cool-new-feature` or `devel-fix-issue-420`. Only once the
branch is considered stable enough for testing should a pull request be made to
`devel`.

The `main` branch is for only release-ready code. Only once the `devel` branch
is considered stable for production will it be pulled into `main`. Releases will
be tagged with a version number.

Version numbering is `major.minor.revision` where `revision` is smaller edits
and bug fixes, `minor` is feature releases, and `major` is core changes that are
not guaranteed backwards compatibility.
