# *noun*, el·ef·jee, [ɛl.ɛf.dʒi]

An online community and web app to help connect gamers. Named after the verbal
pronunciation of the commonly used abbreviation 'LFG' for the phrase 'looking
for group'. The goal is to give all gamers an easy-to-use cross-platform way to
meet other like-minded gamers of any of their chosen games. From co-op in the
latest battle-royale on whichever console to just sharing moments in an
old-school single-player role-playing game.

# When?

RiskyWhiskey is currently a one-man team but there is hope there will be a
working beta by the first quarter of 2021.
