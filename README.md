*noun*, el·ef·jee, [ɛl.ɛf.dʒi]

An online community and suite of utilities to help connect gamers. Named after
the commonly used abbreviation LFG for the phrase 'looking for group'. The goal
is to give all gamers an easy to use cross-platform way to meet other gamers of
any of their favourite games. From co-op in a battle-royale on whichever console
to just to share moments in a single player role-playing game.
